# Love, Cornell
☆ AppDev Hack Challenge - Fall 2022 ☆

“Big Red Missed Connections meets the Unsent Project.” Are you thinking of someone? Is someone thinking of you? This is an app for Cornell students to submit message to a forum that all other students with the app can view. There are no user profiles or usernames attached to these posts, they are only addressed To and From. Save your favorite letters from the forum, search yours or a friends name, or send a message you’ve been dying to get off your chest with Love, Cornell.
